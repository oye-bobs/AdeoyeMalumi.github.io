# Adeoye's Earth Data Science Journey.


## Welcome

Hello there! I'm Adeoye Malumi, and I am a data analyst.

I've always had a knack for working with numbers, collecting data, and finding trends and patterns that others miss.

This interest led me to begin my journey as a data analyst. It all started from working on a secondary school project with microsoft excel while I was about 13 years old, to joining a data science bootcamp many years later.

For me, being a data analyst is a bit like being a detective. Its a game of tracking the clues within the numbers to find the culprit,catching the culprit and telling detailed stories on how and why the culprit is guilty.
Data Analysis for me has always being more like a game,and this has always been very rewarding and exhilarating for me.

## My Journey to Earth Data Science: Connecting Passion with Purpose

As someone who loves digging into data and studied Earth Sciences in college, I naturally found my way into Earth Data Science. It's a mix of using cool tools to analyze Earth-related info, like maps and measurements from satellites.

During my college days, I got really interested in how Earth works — you know, stuff like rocks, weather, and how everything fits together. But as I learned more, I realized that data could help us understand these things even better.

Earth Data Science is all about using fancy techniques to make sense of tons of Earth info we have. Think of it like putting together puzzle pieces to see the bigger picture. It's super important today because it helps us deal with big issues like climate change, natural disasters, and using resources wisely.

For me, choosing Earth Data Science wasn't just about a job. It felt like following my heart. I believe it's a powerful way to make a difference in our world, by using data to solve real problems.

As I keep exploring this field, I see how it can help us build a safer and healthier planet for everyone. It's exciting to think about how Earth Data Science can shape our future for the better.

Come join me in discovering new ideas that help our planet and communities thrive. Here, we'll mix old-fashioned earth science know-how with the latest technology to make things better for everyone.
